# K-nearest neighbors (Regressor)

**Note**: For more information refer to [[K-nearest neighbors CLF]], this variant is pretty similar to its Classifier counterpart.

When $n = 1$, the prediction will be the target value of the closest data point; and when $n > 1$ the prediction will be the average (_or mean_) of the $n$ closest data points.

## Examples

$n = 1$
