# Supervised Learning

- ==Generalization==: If a model is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data, we say it is able to generalize from the training set to the test set
- ==Overfitting==: Building a model that is too complex for the amount of information we have, it will excel at the training dataset, but it will not _generalize_ to new data
- ==Underfitting==: Building a model that is too simple, it fails to encapsulate the underlying _structure_ of the data

**NOTE**: The larger the dataset, the more complex our model can be

## Basic Models

### Classification

- Binary classification (2 classes)
- Multi-class classification (more than 2 classes)

1. [[K-nearest neighbors CLF]]
2. [[App-ML/Supervised Learning/Logistic Regression]]
3. [[LSVM]]
4. [[Kernelized SVM]]

### Regression

1. [[K-nearest neighbors REG]]
2. [[Linear Regression]]
