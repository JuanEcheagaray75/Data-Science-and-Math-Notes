## Dimensions of the task environment

### Fully observable vs partially observable

If an agent's sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, then the environment is **fully observable**; it is also practically fully observable if the sensors detect all aspects that are relevant to the choice of action, the performance measure determines the relevance of the data to be collected.

If the agent has no sensors, then the task environment is **unobservable** (and no, sometimes agent CAN achieve their goal on those environments)

### Single agent vs multi-agent

As an example, a crossword solver is a single agent, on the other hand, chess is considered to be a multiagent environment (one does not play on its own after all).

How to determine if another entity must be seen as an agent? If the behavior of said entity is best described as maximizing a performance measure that depends on the actions of the agent, then the entity must be seen as an agent.



### Deterministic vs stochastic
### Episodic vs sequential
### Static vs dynamic
### Discrete vs continuous
### Known vs unknown
