# Informed Search Algorithms

---

The general approach taken for informed search algorithms is called _Best First Search_, this is an instance of _tree search_ or _graph search_, but with the added feature of it expanding nodes based on an **evaluation function** $f(n)$. This function is constructed as a cost estimate, so that the node with the lowest cost is expanded first. Most search algorithms include a _heuristic function_ as a component of $f$

In general, a heuristic must be:

- They are arbitrary
- Non-negative
- Specific to the problem
- One constraint, $h(n) \text{where } n$ is a goal node is equal to 0

$$h(n) = \text{estimated cost of the cheapest path from the state at node } n \text{ to a goal state}$$

## Search Algorithms

- Greedy Search
- A*
- Memory bounded heuristic search
	- Recursive best first search

### Greedy Best First Search

It tries to expand the node that is closest to the goal, on the grounds that this is likely to lead to a solution quickly. It evaluates nodes based solely on the heuristic function, so $f(n) = h(n)$.

This algorithm is incomplete even in finite state spaces. The algorithm can get trapped in infinite loops when selecting just the cheapest moves, sometimes in order to reach the goal node a _worse_ move must happen first.

The worst-case time and space complexity for greedy search on its tree variant is $O(b^m)$, where $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space.

### A* Search

The best of the bois, it evaluates $g(n)$, the cost it takes to reach $n$ and $h(n)$, the estimated cost to get from $n$ to the goal node. So, the evaluation function for A* would be:

$$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$$

> We can say that this variant of $f$ represents the estimated cost of the cheapest path going through $n$
 
- A* is both complete and optimal, this is pretty much a generalization of the _Uniform Cost Search_ algorithm, the only difference is that A* also uses an heuristic function.

#### Optimality of A*

See [[#Good heuristics|Good heuristics]] for definitions of _admissibility_ and _consistency_.

A* has the following properties:

1. The tree search version of A* is optimal if $h(n)$ is admissible
2. The graph search version is optimal if $h(n)$ is consistent

## Good heuristics

If you want the informed search algorithm to have a good performance, the heuristic function must be admissible and consistent

### Admissibility

An admissible heuristic is one that never **overestimates** the cost to reach the goal. Because $g(n)$ is the real cost to get to node $n$, and $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$, we have as an immediate consequence that $f(n)$ never overestimates the true cost of a solution along the current path through $n$.

Admissible heuristics are by nature _optimistic_ since they think the cost of solving the problem  is less than it actually is. An example of a good heuristic is the euclidean distance in route finding. In most cases, the agent will not be able to get to the goal state through a straight line (because of obstacles or other constraints). This heuristic is admissible because the shortest path between 2 points will always be a straight line, hence, the straight line cannot be an overestimate.

### Consistency

An stronger condition for optimality is _consistency_. An heuristic function is said to be consistent if, for every node $n$ and every successor $n'$ of $n$ generated by an action $a$, the estimated of reaching the goal from $n$ is not greater than the step cost of getting to $n'$ plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from $n'$:

$$h(n) \leq c(n, a, n') + h(n')$$

If there were a route from $n$ to $G_n$ via $n$ that was cheaper than $h(n)$, that would violate the property that $h(n)$ is a lower bound on the cost to reach $G_n$.

> To put it in simpler words, how can the heuristic be good if you estimate the cost of getting to the goal is higher for a state that was generated to be closer to the goal
