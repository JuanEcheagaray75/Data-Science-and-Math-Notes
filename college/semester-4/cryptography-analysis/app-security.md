# Security in applications

## DevSecOps

DevSecOps is based on the principle of integrating development, security, infrastructure, and operations at every stage in a product's life cycle, from planning and design to ongoing use and support (exhibit). This enables engineers to tackle security and reliability issues more quickly and effectively, making organizations more agile and their digital products and services more secure and reliable. Security, reliability and compliance considerations are built into every agile sprint rather than being handled separately or left until the end of the development process.

The process is broken down into the following steps:

1. **Planning**: professionals must go beyond creating feature-based descriptions, the focus should also be on security and performance, acceptance test criteria, application interface and functionality and threat defense models.
2. **Developing**: approached with a "how to do it" rather than "what to do". It is important for developers to bring together available resources for guidance, have reliable practices and a code review system in place for themselves and others in the team.
3. **Building**: automated build tools can uplift the whole DevSecOps process, these tools ensure test-driven development, standards for release artifact generation and utilize tools to ensure the design aspect is in alignment with the team's coding and security standards through static code analysis.
4. **Testing**: automated testing in DevSecOps should utilize strong testing practices including front-end, back-end, API, database and passive security testing.
5. **Securing**: traditional testing methods always remain in place in DevSecOps exercise, however, somewhere down the line, there is a tendency to identify issues toward the end of the development process.
6. **Deploying**: automated provisioning and deployment can fast-track the development process while making it a more consistent one. Infrastructure-as-Code tools can perform the aforementioned audit-properties and configurations to ensure secure configurations across the IT infrastructure.
7. **Operating**: regular monitoring and upgrades are the Operation's team important tasks. DevSecOps teams ensure to deploy Infrastructure-as-code tools to update and secure the entire organization's infrastructure in a quick and efficient manner with no scope for human error. Operations personnel have to be specially watchful of zero-day vulnerabilities.
8. **Monitoring**: constantly keeping a watch for irregularities in security can save an organization from a breach. Hence, it is essential to implement a strong continuous monitoring program with real-time to keep a track of system performance and identify any exploits in the early stages.
9. **Scaling**: gone are the days when organizations spent precious hours and money on the maintaining of large data centers, with the introduction of virtualization solutions and the cloud, organizations can scale their IT infrastructure or replace it in the event of a threat.
10. **Adapting**: continuous improvement is key to any organization's growth. An organization will only be able to achieve the desired growth if it evolves in its practices and includes DevSecOps practices.
