> The Penetration Testing Execution Standard consists of 7 main sections , these cover everything related to a penetration test - from the initial communication and reasoning behind a pentest, through the intelligence gathering and threat modelling phases where testers are working behind the scenes in order to get a better understanding of the tested organization, through vulnerability research, exploitation and post exploitation, where the technical security expertise of the testers come to play and combine with the business understanding of the engagement, and finally to the reporting, which captures the entire process, in a manner that makes sense to the customer and provides the most value to it.

## Pre-engagement interactions

> [Fuente](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement)

partir de la idea de que no implica si alguien te va a atacar, sino identificar las consecuencias que alg√∫n ataque pueda tener en tu negocio en forma de riesgos.

The aim of this section is to present and explain the tools and techniques available which aid in a successful pre-engagement step of the penetration test.

### Introduction to Scope

Defining the scope is arguably one of the most important components of a penetration test, yet it is also one of th most overlooked. Neglecting to properly complete pre-engagement activities has the potential to open the penetration tester (or firm) to a number of headaches including scope creep, unsatisfied customers and even legal troubles.

### Metrics of Time Estimation

Time estimation are directly tied to the experience of a tester in a certain area. If a tester has significant experience in a certain test he will likely innately be able to determine how long a test will take. If the tester has less experience in the area, re-reading emails and scan logs from previous similar tests the firm has done is a great way to estimate the time requirement for the current engagement. Once the time to test is determined, it is a prudent practice to add 20% to the time.

The extra 20% on the back-end of the time value is called padding. Outside of consultant circles, this is also referred to as consultant overhead
